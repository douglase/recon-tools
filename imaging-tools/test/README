TEST FRAMEWORK
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SETUP:

Running these test scripts requires that the bic testdata be separately
installed or checked out.  That data is bundled separately from the main
project due to its size.

If you do not already have it, the testdata can be checked out from svn at
    https://cirl.berkeley.edu/svn/bic/trunk/testdata.

The test scripts expect the test data to be found as a sibling to the
imaging-tools directory, but may of course be edited to look in a different
location.

RUNNING THE TESTS:

To run the tests, simply execute one of the test scripts found in this
directory.  The testing framework is still crude and does not include any
unit tests.  The test-recon.sh script may be edited to test the recon tool
with a number of raw data files in the testdata distribution.  Simply
uncomment the desired data set and comment the currently active one.
