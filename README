Recon Tools:

A collection of tools and libraries for reconstructing and undistorting MR 
image data developed at the University of California Berkeley's Helen Wills 
Neuroscience Institute Brain Imaging Center.
For documentation, see https://cirl.berkeley.edu/view/BIC/ImagingTools

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:

The Recon Tools package provides a number of command-line tools for
manipulating MR image data, as well as a code library of reusable components.
The central types of objects in the recon-tools system are data readers,
transformers, and writers.  Image manipulation tools can be created by
composing appropriate combinations of these core objects into a pipeline
beginning with a reader, followed by a sequence of transformers (called
Operations), and ending with a writer.  Image data in the pipeline is
represented by an Image object conforming to a conventional Image interface.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LIBRARY DEPENDENCIES:
Recon Tools is written in Python 2.4, making use these additional libraries:

numpy > 1.0
matplotlib > 0.87

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILDING/INSTALLING THE PYTHON WAY
It is necessary to compile the phase surface unwrapping module included 
with Recon Tools before installing. To do so, type:

python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
USING MAKE (the iffy way):

make install:       installs tools, library, and documentation
make tools-rpm:     build an RPM for installing the tools and library
make docs:          generate some documentation from code
make install-docs:  install documentation (/usr/share/doc/recon-tools)
make docs-rpm:      build an RPM for install the documentation
make test:          run test suite
make clean:         remove all generated files

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TESTING:

To test your installation, a collection of example datasets and oplists is 
available at the CIRL wiki:

https://cirl.berkeley.edu/twiki/pub/BIC/ReconTools/testsuite.tar.bz2

To use the testing util, type:

tar jxf testsuite.tar.bz2
cd testsuite
./test.sh
