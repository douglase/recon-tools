This directory contains the Varian phase-encode tables which have been 
modified for use with recon. The first line contains the acquisition 
order of the k-space lines. Any navigator echos are 
assumed to be acquired at the beginning of a segment and are therefore
not assigned a line number.


One of the first chores of recon is to organize the data into a conventional 
ordering of the data so that various operations may be performed upon the data 
in a manner independent of the order of collection of the phase-encode lines of 
data.

Because Python does not allow indices of arrays (or lists) to start at negative 
values the convention in recon is to number the phase-encode lines as 0 
through 2N-1 where we assume there are 2N phase encode lines (2N = n_pe_true). 
With this convention the phase-encode gradient has zero magnitude at line N. 
The following diagram makes this convention clear for the first and second slices 
within a volume (block) of slices:

The phase-encode-tables used by recon are created by hand from the scanner-
vendor's phase-encode-table files. While we could use the vendors phase-encode-
tables directly a coding simplification is acheived by using our own file format 
for the phase-encode-tables. Since this need be done only once it is of no great 
cost given benefits. The recon phase-encode-table files are stored in a 
directory named "tablib" under the recon.scanners.varian package.

The different vendors will store their phase-encode tables in different system 
directories. The Varian scanner has the phase-encode tables stored in a directory 
named tablib.
