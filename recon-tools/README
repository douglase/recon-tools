SUMMARY:

The recon-tools package provides a number of command-line tools for
manipulating image data, as well as a code library of reusable components.
The central types of objects in the recon-tools system are data readers,
transformers, and writers.  Image manipulation tools can be created by
composing appropriate combinations of these core objects into a pipeline
beginning with a reader, followed by a sequence of transformers (called
Operations), and ending with a writer.  Image data in the pipeline is
represented by an Image object conforming to a conventional Image interface.
